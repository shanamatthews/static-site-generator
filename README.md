# Static site generator + blog

This is a super simple static site generator written with `pandoc` and a few lines of bash script.

The [build](https://github.com/shanamatthews/static-site-generator/blob/main/build) script is what generates the site.

Run locally with my [`preview`](https://github.com/shanamatthews/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/preview) script.

Idea inspired by [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob/).
