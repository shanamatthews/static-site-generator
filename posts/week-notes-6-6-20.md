This week sucks, to be honest. I'm so glad that people (including little old me) are out in the streets protesting and getting shit done, but it SUCKS BAD to have constant police presence, helicopter noise, and violence against protestors including tear gas that seeps into my apartment and keeps me up at night. We must keep fighting.

# Knitting

I made good progress on the [Rain Wilds tank](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/stinkerelly/rain-wilds-top). Knitting is one of the few things that helps me calm lately. Sorry, no progress pics.

# Kombucha

Buch flavors of the week:

- pineapple
- mixed berry

Neither of these turned out well. Even the pineapple didn't carbonate, and pineapple usually gets soooo fizzy üò¢

# Books

- [finished] [*The Golden Compass*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass) on audiobook. This book has been how I've found calm lately. Either walks around the neighborhood while listening, or knitting and listening. I can't believe I totally missed this series as a kid! I thought it was too much of a "kids book" and I was too sophisticated of a reader for it. Boy was I wrong! Time to dive into the sequel.

- [finished] [*A Study in Scarlet Women*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28588390-a-study-in-scarlet-women). I didn't love this book even though I wanted to. A feminist, period piece mystery sounded right up my alley, but I had a hard time getting into it. Honestly, it felt difficult keeping track of all the characters, which I NEVER have a problem with. I will probably try the sequel, but if I don't get into it, I'm done with this series.

- [in-progress] [*Biased*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40407320-biased) on audiobook. I powered through most of this book this week, with just a bit left to go. I'm loving it so far, but will write up some thoughts next week.

- [in-progress] [*The War for Kindness*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42729353-the-war-for-kindness) on audiobook. Barely started this one. Hope to pick it up more once I've finished *Biased*.

- [in-progress] [*Ulysses*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses). I basically expect this one to remain in-progress forever. After picking this book out, the boyfriend decided it wasn't for him after about five pages. We're going to go with something more gentle instead (see next in-progress book). I'm going to do my best to keep going on Ulysses, but we will see...

- [in-progress] [*A Game of Thrones*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones) jointly with the boyfriend. While I've read all 5 books multiple times, and we've both watched the (abominable) HBO series, the boyfriend has NEVER read any of the ASOIAF books! So, after he gave up on *Ulysses*, I decided I'm forcing him to read the series. I think he's enjoying it okay so far üòù
