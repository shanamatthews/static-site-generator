    <h1 class="title">Static site generator with <code>pandoc</code> +
Bash</h1>
      <p class="date">2022-03-15</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve been playing around with POSIX and Bash scripting lately.
    I‚Äôve always really enjoyed shell scripting - I find it really
    intuitive and simple to get things done.</p>
    <p>I was inspired by a tangent a streamer (rwxrob) went off on
    lately about how you could easily set up a basic static site
    generator using <code>pandoc</code> and some bash scripting so I
    decided to do it!</p>
    <p>This site is generated from markdown files which I pass through
    <code>pandoc</code> using templates, all coordinated by (what is
    currently) one Bash script.</p>
    <p>In the past, I‚Äôve set up sites using Jekyll and Hugo, but I hated
    how bloated they were for what I really needed. I didn‚Äôt want a
    fancy theme or interactivity or SEO, or‚Ä¶ anything else. I also
    strongly prefer to be able to understand everything in my setup and
    how better to do that than to make it yourself?</p>
