    <h1 class="title">week notes 6/14/2020</h1>
      <p>It’s been a weird, rough week in Seattle. The police violence
      against protesters came to a head, the Capitol Hill Autonomous
      Zone (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CHAZ">CHAZ</a>) was
      formed, and then was renamed to the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest
      (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CHOP">CHOP</a>) (a much
      better name). I can say from firsthand experience that the area
      feels very safe, and is much less violent than the police were
      previously. I hope that the space is able to achieve its goals of
      defunding the police, promoting anti-racism, and helping to get
      justice for Black victims of police crimes.</p>
      <p>There’s been a lot more open discussion about the Black Lives
      Matter movement and protests at work, which I’m thankful for, but
      there’s still a lot of old white men acting defensive. I get the
      impression most folks at work haven’t yet made the leap from
      “Racism is bad” to “We need <em>anti</em>-racism”.</p>
      <p>My workplace is taking <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth">Juneteenth</a> as
      a day of learning and reflection. Hopefully I can do my small part
      to help educate.</p>

      Wilds tank top</a> is almost done!</p>

      <p>I haven’t made a ton of progress lately because all I have left
      to do are the back straps and making straps, (as I have
      discovered) is NO FUN!</p>
      <h2 id="kombucha">Kombucha</h2>
      <p>Flavors of the week:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>mixed berry</li>
      <li>unflavored</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both “flavors” got 1 tbsp + 1 tsp of white sugar per liter.</p>
      <p>I’ve only tried the mixed berry so far, but I really liked it!
      The boyfriend thinks it tastes “alcohol-y”, but I don’t personally
      taste it.</p>
      <h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40407320-biased"><em>Biased</em></a>.
      I really liked this book. The author, Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt,
      spoke very frankly about biases in general, but spent most of her
      time on racial bias. Dr. Eberhardt neither absolves those with
      bias of blame (“It’s not your fault - everyone has biases!”) nor
      comes off as preachy and fatalistic (“Everyone is biased and
      there’s nothing we can do about it!”). It brings both personal,
      emotional stories, and hard data to the table, but it doesn’t
      bring all the answers. Dr. Eberhardt didn’t explain how we can
      fully overcome our biases individually or as a society, but she
      did give me the motivation to keep trying.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119324.The_Subtle_Knife"><em>The
      Subtle Knife</em></a> on audiobook. I’m enjoying it about as much
      as the <em>Golden Compass</em>, but I’m just not the best at
      audiobooks. I’ve been listening while playing Stardew Valley on my
      Switch!</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones"><em>A
      Game of Thrones</em></a> jointly with the boyfriend. I’ve gotten
      lots of questions on how we read together. Maybe we’re weirdos,
      but we physically read the book at the same time. It’s nice
      quality time together! I’m definitely the faster reader, but I
      take my time, sometimes going back to re-read or particularly
      interesting bits while waiting on him.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33835806-a-conspiracy-in-belgravia"><em>A
      Conspiracy in Belgravia</em></a>. I’m almost done with this book
      and I’m actually enjoying it a lot more than the first book in the
      series. In the previous novel, I was struggling to keep track of
      the cast, which I usually don’t have any issue with. There haven’t
      been too many new characters introduced in this sequel, so I’ve
      really been able to get into it, and the not-so-subtle feminist
      themes.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42729353-the-war-for-kindness"><em>The
      War for Kindness</em></a>. I’ve only made a little progress on
      this one, probably because it’s an audiobook 😕 I’ll pick it up a
      bit more once I finish <em>The Subtle Knife</em>, which I’m
      rushing to beat the library due date on.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses">Ulysses</a>.
      I made some discoveries that may increase my chances of finishing
      this one!</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>First, is the amazing <a
      href="https://blog.frankdelaney.com/re-joyce/">re: Joyce
      podcast</a>. While tragically, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Delaney">Frank
      Delaney</a> passed away before being able to complete this
      monumental project, what exists of this podcast is an extremely
      comprehensive, accessible (sometimes) line-by-line annotative
      commentary of <em>Ulysses</em>. I like to sit down with my copy of
      the book, a pencil, headphones, and <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSM0RL-z5D7CiqGhbgzoBx4XkkS86C7iS">this
      YouTube playlist</a> of all the 5-minute podcast episodes and take
      it all in. (Yes, I write all over my books.)</p></li>
      <li><p>Next, this adorable 90’s-ish website (<a
      href="http://www.joyceproject.com/"
      class="uri">http://www.joyceproject.com/</a>) with color-coded
      inline annotations to the book. This will be the next-best thing
      once I run out of re: Joyce podcast episodes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Finally, the <a
      href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Annotations_to_James_Joyce%27s_Ulysses">Wikibooks
      annotated version of <em>Ulysses</em></a>. I knew Wikibooks
      existed, but thought of it as just for textbooks, so I was
      delighted to discover this resource. In general, <a
      href="http://www.joyceproject.com/"
      class="uri">http://www.joyceproject.com/</a> seems to be more
      comprehensive, but there’s some non-overlapping info to be found
      here too.</p>
      <p>This is going to be a long read!</p></li>
      </ul></li>
