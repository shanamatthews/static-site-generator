Week notes! Week notes!

It's my birthday this week üßÅ and I'm also in India for a wedding!

## Projects

I'm literally in India right now, so not exactly getting things done (GTD¬Æ[^1]), but here's some things I liked while I was traveling:

## Reading

Articles I liked this week:

- [Regex crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/), not an article, but you'll like it. I've been really into crosswords lately, but I super suck at crosswords. Cultural references from the 80s just aren't my thing. This is better.

Books:

- [in-progress] [Never Bet Against Occam](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20811242W/Never_Bet_Against_Occam). Reading this to learn more about mastocytosis :(
- [in-progress] [My Grandmother's Hands](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19718843W/My_grandmother%27s_hands?edition=ia%3Amygrandmothersha0000mena)
- [in-progress] [Moby Dick](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL21501229W/Moby_Dick?edition=ia%3Amobydick0000melv_c9t5)
- [paused] [Spare](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL29240850W/Spare)
- [paused] [Unsettled Ground](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL25758323W/Unsettled_Ground)
- [finished] [The Summer I Turned Pretty](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5819962W/The_Summer_I_Turned_Pretty?edition=key%3A/books/OL17029559M). Listened to this one on the plane back from India. It wasn't good, but it was fluffy and sweet. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
- [finished] [By Blood](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16239773W/By_blood?edition=ia%3Abyblood0000ullm_u3v1). I listened to this audiobook while being driven between cities in north India. It was odd, but I enjoyed it. Based on the contents, it felt like the author herself might be gay and Jewish... ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
- [finished], [reread] [Return of the King](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27516W/The_Return_of_the_King?edition=ia%3Aleretourduroi0000tolk). Oof, this is the sloggiest of the trilogy. A book club read that I'm rereading for the first time since I was a kid. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

[^1]: this is a really stupid non-joke for myself. I'm not a fan of commoditized productivity systems like [the GTD method](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).
