    <p>I’ve been playing around with POSIX and Bash scripting lately. I’ve always really enjoyed shell scripting - I find it really intuitive and simple to get things done.</p>
    <p>I was inspired by a tangent a streamer (rwxrob) went off on lately about how you could easily set up a basic static site generator using <code>pandoc</code> and some bash scripting so I decided to do it!</p>
    <p>This site is generated from markdown files which I pass through <code>pandoc</code> using templates, all coordinated by (what is currently) one Bash script.</p>
    <p>In the past, I’ve set up sites using Jekyll and Hugo, but I hated how bloated they were for what I really needed. I didn’t want a fancy theme or interactivity or SEO, or… anything else. I also strongly prefer to be able to understand everything in my setup and how better to do that than to make it yourself?</p>
