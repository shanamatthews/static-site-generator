    <h1 class="title">Doesn’t socialism always end up in
dictatorship?</h1>
      <p>I was taught that socialism can’t work because it always leads
      to a dictatorship, as seen in:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>China</li>
      <li>Soviet Union</li>
      <li>Venezuela</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Marxist socialism was conceived of by and for strong,
      prosperous post-capitalist societies (France, pre-war Germany).
      These countries would already have enough money and capital to
      redistribute and put power in the hands of an educated working
      class.</p>
      <p>However, capitalists already had a lot of power in these
      societies and used this power to stamp out socialism out of self
      interest.</p>
      <p>Less-wealthy countries that imported these ideas (Soviet Union,
      China, Venezuela) were able to implement socialist and communist
      policies because capitalists did not have as much power yet.</p>
      <p>But, socialism was not invented for these pre-industrial,
      agrarian societies, it had to be heavily adapted.</p>
      <p>Instead of a way to redistribute wealth/capital, leaders
      attempted to use it as a way to industrialize their society. Out
      of necessity, these governments prioritized state-led
      industrialization over democratic rights.</p>
      <p>Current Marxist-socialist thinking didn’t have any ideas or
      plans for how a country should develop and industrialize, but in
      hindsight we can see that the interpretation of socialism by these
      developing countries did not stay true to Marx’s motivations.</p>
      <p>The only places where socialism was able to take hold were the
      places that were not ready for it. And it was only ABLE to take
      hold because they were not ready for it.</p>
