      <p>Happy 4th of July everyone! I had a busy long weekend, starting
      with a backpacking trip to <a
      href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/navaho-peak">Navaho
      Peak</a>, camping in the meadows beneath. It was beautiful and a
      little challenging with our packs. We’ve hardly been hiking all
      season due to the rona and we might be a bit out of shape 😉</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We took Thursday off and left for the trailhead at 8am with
      some friends. It took about 3 hours to hike to our desired
      campsite. Fortunately it wasn’t too busy when we arrived, but by
      the time we left on Friday afternoon, the meadows were
      <strong>packed</strong>. I’m really glad we camped Thursday night
      to avoid the crowds.</p>
      <p>On Thursday afternoon we visited the pass, a short hike up from
      the campsite.</p>

      <p>Then on Friday morning, we went all the way up to Navaho Peak.
      The hike from the pass to the peak was pretty grueling, but we
      didn’t have any packs to carry up so we made it okay!</p>

      <p>The boyfriend and I got back Friday evening and PTFO (a
      friend’s acronym - guess what it means 😂). We woke up a little
      sore, but recovered pretty quickly.</p>
      <p>On Saturday the 4th, I took time out to participate in the <a
      href="https://socialismconference.org/">Socialism 2020
      conference</a>. I found it interesting, but there were quite a few
      technical difficulties. Because of the current racial
      conversations, most speakers had a strong racial justice theme to
      their message, which I appreciated. But as someone new to the
      ideas of socialism (rather than just democratic socialism), I was
      hoping for a bit more of the fundamentals.</p>
      <p>I also took the time to read Frederick Douglass’s full speech
      “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” (linked below). It was
      so moving and really put the Fourth of July in a different
      perspective for me. Sam and I did not celebrate this year.</p>
      <p>If you’re more of a video person, <a
      href="https://youtu.be/NBe5qbnkqoM">here’s a version of the speech
      read by descendants of Frederick Douglass</a>.</p>
      <h1 id="knitting">Knitting</h1>
      <p>I actually haven’t knitted <strong>at all</strong> recently!
      Instead, I’ve been crocheting! Crazy.</p>
      <p>I haven’t picked up a crochet hook since I was a kid, but I was
      super inspired to make <a

      Slouchy Hanging Baskets</a> by Two of Wands.</p>

      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Beautiful baskets</figcaption>

      <p>Mine didn’t turn out quite as elegant - but it’s super useful!
      I have it stretched full of work stuff (notebooks, pens,
      chapstick, etc.) that used to be scattered around my WFH
      workstation.</p>

      <p>Crocheting came back to me easily and the pattern was dead
      simple. I enjoyed making it while watching TV or listening to
      audiobooks. I think I might even make another before I start my
      next big knitting project!</p>

      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8852.Macbeth"><em>Macbeth</em></a>.
      I really enjoyed digging into some Shakespeare again! I spent
      almost all of Sunday emerging myself in this book. I watched and
      listened to some interpretations, analyses, and performances:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/PFwHmgA9nno">The Globe’s 2020

      the Wild</em></a>. This was only an okay read for me. I had really
      high expectations based on my experience with <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air"><em>Into
      Thin Air</em></a>, but I didn’t find Chris McCandless’s story as
      riveting, just sad. Unlike Krakauer, I really couldn’t relate to
      Chris and his choices. What a tragedy.</p></li>

      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119324.The_Subtle_Knife"><em>The
