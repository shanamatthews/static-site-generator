Happy 4th of July everyone! I had a busy long weekend, starting with a backpacking trip to [Navaho Peak](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/navaho-peak), camping in the meadows beneath. It was beautiful and a little challenging with our packs. We've hardly been hiking all season due to the rona and we might be a bit out of shape 😉

We took Thursday off and left for the trailhead at 8am with some friends. It took about 3 hours to hike to our desired campsite. Fortunately it wasn't too busy when we arrived, but by the time we left on Friday afternoon, the meadows were **packed**. I'm really glad we camped Thursday night to avoid the crowds.

On Thursday afternoon we visited the pass, a short hike up from the campsite.

Then on Friday morning, we went all the way up to Navaho Peak. The hike from the pass to the peak was pretty grueling, but we didn't have any packs to carry up so we made it okay!

The boyfriend and I got back Friday evening and PTFO (a friend's acronym - guess what it means 😂). We woke up a little sore, but recovered pretty quickly.

On Saturday the 4th, I took time out to participate in the [Socialism 2020 conference](https://socialismconference.org/). I found it interesting, but there were quite a few technical difficulties. Because of the current racial conversations, most speakers had a strong racial justice theme to their message, which I appreciated. But as someone new to the ideas of socialism (rather than just democratic socialism), I was hoping for a bit more of the fundamentals.

I also took the time to read Frederick Douglass's full speech “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” (linked below). It was so moving and really put the Fourth of July in a different perspective for me. Sam and I did not celebrate this year.

# Knitting

I actually haven't knitted **at all** recently! Instead, I've been crocheting! Crazy.

I haven't picked up a crochet hook since I was a kid, but I was super inspired to make [these Slouchy Hanging Baskets](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/slouchy-hanging-baskets) by Two of Wands.

![Beautiful baskets](https://images4-g.ravelrycache.com/uploads/TwoOfWands/702079049/EF264ED7-A311-4DD6-8B55-73D6B7569414_medium2.JPG)

Mine didn't turn out quite as elegant - but it's super useful! I have it stretched full of work stuff (notebooks, pens, chapstick, etc.) that used to be scattered around my WFH workstation.

Crocheting came back to me easily and the pattern was dead simple. I enjoyed making it while watching TV or listening to audiobooks. I think I might even make another before I start my next big knitting project!

# Reading

- [finished] [*Macbeth*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8852.Macbeth). I really enjoyed digging into some Shakespeare again! I spent almost all of Sunday emerging myself in this book. I watched and listened to some interpretations, analyses, and performances:
  - [The Globe's 2020 performance](https://youtu.be/PFwHmgA9nno) on YouTube
  - John Green's two part Crash Course Literature analysis: [part 1](https://youtu.be/VPYOs0EGgJk), [part 2](https://youtu.be/4zdkun4xzOs)
  - A [recording of Ian McKellen](https://youtu.be/zGbZCgHQ9m8) analyzing the "Tomorrow" speech
  - The [2015 Macbeth movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2884018/) with Michael Fassbender

- [finished] [*Into the Wild*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1845.Into_the_Wild). This was only an okay read for me. I had really high expectations based on my experience with [*Into Thin Air*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air), but I didn't find Chris McCandless's story as riveting, just sad. Unlike Krakauer, I really couldn't relate to Chris and his choices. What a tragedy.

- [in-progress] [*The Hollow of Fear*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36342330-the-hollow-of-fear). I've only got a few days left on my library loan for this one, so I'm going to speed through it, I'm sure!

- [in-progress] [*The Amber Spyglass*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18122.The_Amber_Spyglass) on audiobook. I'm about 2/3rds of the way through this on audiobook, and I think I'm actually enjoying it more than [*The Subtle Knife*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119324.The_Subtle_Knife) so far. I'm digging the religious themes - god as a not-so-benevolent ruler who took power by force? Yeah!

- [in-progress] [*A Game of Thrones*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones). Sam and I are really stalling on this - we've been watching Netflix instead of reading lately!

  > "The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. — The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn."

  > "The affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts and are central to any future prospect of retreating to safer environmental conditions."

  > "Any transition towards sustainability can only be effective if far-reaching lifestyle changes complement technological advancements. However, existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits necessary societal change."
