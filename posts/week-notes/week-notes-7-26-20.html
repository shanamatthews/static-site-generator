      <p>Hello friends!</p>
      <p>Coming at you again after another long weekend, courtesy of a
      vacation day used on Friday 7/24.</p>
      <p>Myself, the boyfriend, and a few friends went backpacking from
      <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/third-beach">Third
      Beach</a> to <a
      href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/toleak-point">Toleak
      Point</a> on the coast this weekend and had a blast. I did this
      same trip last year with a similar group of friends and had the
      best time. We‚Äôve been wanting to go back, but Third Beach has been
      closed most of the year due to coronavirus precautions. When it
      finally opened back up, I grabbed backpacking permits right
      away!</p>

      <p>One of my friends took an amazing photo of the milky way from
      the beach (while I went to sleep üòÖ)</p>

      <p>Overall it was an amazing trip and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll go back again
      soon!</p>
      <p>In other news, I‚Äôve gotten back into (bullet-ish) journaling.
      It‚Äôs mostly normal journaling, in a fancy dotted notebook, with
      some inspiration from <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet
      Journaling</a>, like keeping it short in your daily and expanding
      in a different section later, and keeping a table of contents. I‚Äôm
      not that artsy, but here‚Äôs an example of a monthly layout for
      me:</p>

      <p>After the wild success of my last <a
      href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/slouchy-hanging-baskets">Slouchy
      Hanging Basket</a>, I decided to make another!</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm not too far into it yet, but the idea is to use up a bunch
      of stash yarn I‚Äôve probably had for a decade (yikes) and don‚Äôt
      want to use for a garment.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm still putting off making my <a
      href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/knitorious-rbg">Knitorious
      RBG</a> because I know it is going to be a PROJECT. It‚Äôs also
      super hot here (90¬∞F right now) and working on a sweater doesn‚Äôt
      sound so appealing.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôve been really enjoying my crop tops at home in the heat
      (with no AC), so I‚Äôm thinking my next project might be <a
      href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-pamela-bandeau">The
      Pamela Bandeau</a>‚Ä¶</p>

      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36342330-the-hollow-of-fear"><em>The
      Hollow of Fear</em></a>. This was so good!! My favorite yet of the
      series. I‚Äôm not sure why this series was a slow start for me, but
      I‚Äôm super glad I‚Äôve stuck with it. No spoilers, but the series
      <em>finally</em> took the turn I‚Äôve been wanting it to make all
      along, and I feel that Charlotte was her most fleshed-out, badass,
      and real yet. I CANNOT wait to get my hands on the next
      one!</p></li>
      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18122.The_Amber_Spyglass"><em>The
      Amber Spyglass</em></a> on audiobook. Okay, this was a pretty big
      disappointment. The series overall started strong, but took a
      downward dive quickly. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the second book, but
      I thought the finale might redeem it. It did not. The
      world-building was just not there, and the plot was all over the
      place. Even the religious themes, far from improving the books,
      felt underdeveloped and begrudging. Why was this series so
      popular?</p></li>
      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30821598-my-not-so-perfect-life"><em>My
      Not So Perfect Life</em></a>. I saw this going around on
      Bookstagram a while back and I put a hold at my local library. I
      finally decided I was ready for a nice breezy read and finished it
      in a couple of sittings. It was really fun and cute!</p></li>
      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502567-dream-hoarders"><em>Dream
      Hoarders</em></a>. I heard about this book from <a
      href="https://youtu.be/pTgpgMzs5sU">an interview with the author
      from the Aspen Institute</a>. The author seemed fun and the
      message seemed interesting, so I thought I‚Äôd give the book a try.
      It was a pretty quick read, and overall I wasn‚Äôt <em>that</em>
      impressed. Reeves argues that the upper middle class are pulling
      away from the lower middle class, reducing social mobility. While
      those arguments seemed valid, he was also intent on arguing that
      this split between the lower and upper middle classes was a larger
      issue than the super-wealthy 1%. Unfortunately, no data he laid
      out in the book convinced me that this was the case. I finished
      the book convinced that there is a moral imperative to put
      measures into place that improve social mobility between the lower
      and upper middle classes, but the 1% are still the ones buying
      elections and I refuse to release them from
      responsibility.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones"><em>A
      Game of Thrones</em></a>. The boyfriend decided he didn‚Äôt really
      want to read this series after all, so I‚Äôm on my own! Fine by me,
      I‚Äôm due for another (slow) reread üòù</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35099718-so-you-want-to-talk-about-race"><em>So
      You Want to Talk About Race</em></a> on audiobook. About halfway
      through this one, and enjoying it quite a bit so far. I‚Äôm finding
      parts of it a bit basic, especially in comparison to <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40265832-how-to-be-an-antiracist"><em>How
      to Be an Antiracist</em></a>, which I LOVED, but I‚Äôd recommend it
      to folks who are new to the ideas of structural racism.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15575.The_Sword_of_Shannara"><em>The
      Sword of Shannara</em></a> I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm only reading this
      because I was craving a nice physical read. I‚Äôve had it on my
      shelf for <em>years</em> and never bothered to get into it. My mom
      liked this series, and there was a (bad) TV adaption a few years
      ago, so I bought a copy, but I‚Äôd heard that it was basically a bad
      clone of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> series and I never started
      it. So far, I‚Äôm actually liking it! The LoTR comparisons are
      obvious and easy to make, but I‚Äôm trying to just take the book for
      what it is - some fun fantasy!</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51704136-little-fires-everywhere"><em>Little
      Fires Everywhere</em></a>. This was another Bookstagram book that
      I wanted to check out. I‚Äôm about a third of the way through and
      enjoying it pretty well. I like the family dynamics and air of
      slight mystery, but I‚Äôm not loving how much it focuses on
      motherhood and mother/daughter relationships. Just some hangups
      from my own life, nothing against the book. More thoughts
      soon!</p></li>

      <li>Old, but I missed it when it came out: <a

      Next Big Blue-Collar Job Is Coding</a></li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúWhat if the next big blue-collar job category is already
      here‚Äîand it‚Äôs programming? What if we regarded code not as a
      high-stakes, sexy affair, but the equivalent of skilled work at a
      Chrysler plant?‚Äù</p>
