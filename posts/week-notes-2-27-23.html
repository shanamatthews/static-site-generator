    <p>Trying out writing week notes again! 👯‍♀️</p>
    <p>I’m not making kombucha anymore (rip) and barely knitting, so
    sadly I can’t continue my previous format from 2020. I’ll try out
    some sections this week and see how they feel.</p>
    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <p>I’ve been in a personal-projects slump recently, as evidenced by
    my GitHub activity chart, yikes.</p>

    <p>This is mostly because of some health stuff that came up early in
    January and I’m still dealing with. However, I’ve been doing better
    over the last couple of weeks and I’ve found some energy and
    excitement to start playing around, particularly with
    ChatGPT-related things.</p>
    <h3 id="this-website">This website</h3>
    <p>Read my <a
    href="https://shana.codes/posts/chatgpt-site-improvements.html">writeup
    on adding a new feature to this site</a> with the “help” of
    ChatGPT.</p>

    <p>I read <a
    href="https://supabase.com/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs">this super
    cool article</a> this week about Supabase adding ChatGPT to answer
    questions based off their docs.</p>
    <p>They created such a nice writeup and video of the process, I
    wanted to play around with a similar setup in <a
    href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s docs</a>.</p>
    <p>I didn’t get very far because our docs our on a very old version
    of Gatsby (2.32.13, yikes), which is not compatible with Supabase. I
    figured rather than trying my luck with other postgres DBs that
    might support both <a
    href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector"><code>pgvector</code></a>
    and Gatsby v2, I’d just set up a proof of concept by copying our
    docs markdown files into a newer project and set up Supabase with
    that project.</p>
    <p>I decided to try <a href="https://markdoc.dev/">Markdoc</a>,
    since I’ve been wanting to play with it more since my first
    experiments with it at Coinbase. However, we use .mdx files, Mardoc
    only supports it’s own flavor of markdown… whew. It quickly turned
    into a lot, as these things often do.</p>
    <p>This is still a work in progress. Hopefully more updates next
    week!</p>
