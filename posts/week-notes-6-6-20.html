    <h1 class="title">week notes 6/6/2020</h1>
      <p>This week sucks, to be honest. I‚Äôm so glad that people
      (including little old me) are out in the streets protesting and
      getting shit done, but it SUCKS BAD to have constant police
      presence, helicopter noise, and violence against protestors
      including tear gas that seeps into my apartment and keeps me up at
      night. We must keep fighting.</p>
      <h1 id="knitting">Knitting</h1>
      <p>I made good progress on the <a
      href="https://www.ravelry.com/projects/stinkerelly/rain-wilds-top">Rain
      Wilds tank</a>. Knitting is one of the few things that helps me
      calm lately. Sorry, no progress pics.</p>
      <h1 id="kombucha">Kombucha</h1>
      <p>Buch flavors of the week:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>pineapple</li>
      <li>mixed berry</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Neither of these turned out well. Even the pineapple didn‚Äôt
      carbonate, and pineapple usually gets soooo fizzy üò¢</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass"><em>The
      Golden Compass</em></a> on audiobook. This book has been how I‚Äôve
      found calm lately. Either walks around the neighborhood while
      listening, or knitting and listening. I can‚Äôt believe I totally
      missed this series as a kid! I thought it was too much of a ‚Äúkids
      book‚Äù and I was too sophisticated of a reader for it. Boy was I
      wrong! Time to dive into the sequel.</p></li>
      <li><p>[finished] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28588390-a-study-in-scarlet-women"><em>A
      Study in Scarlet Women</em></a>. I didn‚Äôt love this book even
      though I wanted to. A feminist, period piece mystery sounded right
      up my alley, but I had a hard time getting into it. Honestly, it
      felt difficult keeping track of all the characters, which I NEVER
      have a problem with. I will probably try the sequel, but if I
      don‚Äôt get into it, I‚Äôm done with this series.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40407320-biased"><em>Biased</em></a>
      on audiobook. I powered through most of this book this week, with
      just a bit left to go. I‚Äôm loving it so far, but will write up
      some thoughts next week.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42729353-the-war-for-kindness"><em>The
      War for Kindness</em></a> on audiobook. Barely started this one.
      Hope to pick it up more once I‚Äôve finished
      <em>Biased</em>.</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses"><em>Ulysses</em></a>.
      I basically expect this one to remain in-progress forever. After
      picking this book out, the boyfriend decided it wasn‚Äôt for him
      after about five pages. We‚Äôre going to go with something more
      gentle instead (see next in-progress book). I‚Äôm going to do my
      best to keep going on Ulysses, but we will see‚Ä¶</p></li>
      <li><p>[in-progress] <a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones"><em>A
      Game of Thrones</em></a> jointly with the boyfriend. While I‚Äôve
      read all 5 books multiple times, and we‚Äôve both watched the
      (abominable) HBO series, the boyfriend has NEVER read any of the
      ASOIAF books! So, after he gave up on <em>Ulysses</em>, I decided
      I‚Äôm forcing him to read the series. I think he‚Äôs enjoying it okay
      so far üòù</p></li>
