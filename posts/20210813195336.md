I've been playing around with POSIX  and Bash scripting lately. I've always really enjoyed shell scripting - I find it really intuitive and simple to get things done.

I was inspired by a tangent a streamer (rwxrob) went off on lately about how you could easily set up a basic static site generator using `pandoc` and some bash scripting so I decided to do it!

This site is generated from markdown files which I pass through `pandoc` using templates, all coordinated by (what is currently) one Bash script.

In the past, I've set up sites using Jekyll and Hugo, but I hated how bloated they were for what I really needed. I didn't want a fancy theme or interactivity or SEO, or... anything else. I also strongly prefer to be able to understand everything in my setup and how better to do that than to make it yourself?
