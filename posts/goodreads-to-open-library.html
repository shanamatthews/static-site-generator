    <h1 class="title">Switching from Goodreads to Open Library</h1>
      <p class="date">2022-04-18</p>
    <p>Sometime during the last year (what even is pandemic time) I was
    exploring D3.js for kicks. One of the projects I created was a
    ‚Äúvirtual bookshelf‚Äù that would pull the books I was currently
    reading or just finished from the Goodreads API and display them. My
    hope was to create something pretty (judge for yourself ü•≤) that I
    could download regularly and use as a Zoom background.</p>
    <p>The project was a lot of fun (<a
    href="https://observablehq.com/@shanamatthews/spine-generator-v2">check
    out the code</a> if you‚Äôre curious) and was going pretty well. D3
    was a lot of fun for someone who knew absolutely nothing about SVG
    and Canvas and not a ton about HTML and Javascript.</p>

    <h6 id="i-might-have-missed-the-mark-on-pretty.">I might have missed
    the mark on ‚Äúpretty‚Äù.</h6>
    <p>However, after taking a break from the project for a few weeks
    when life got busy, I came back to a totally broken project. Maybe
    not that surprising, it wasn‚Äôt exactly robust code‚Ä¶ But once I dug
    in, I realized that my calls to the Goodreads API weren‚Äôt working
    anymore. My API key had expired during my time away from the
    project‚Ä¶ weird. I‚Äôm not sure how quickly API keys normally expire,
    but no big deal, I‚Äôll just grab a new one!</p>
    <p>No dice. Goodreads had decided to stop issuing new developer keys
    (and shut off any that hadn‚Äôt been active in a few weeks) without
    any warning. I already wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Goodreads, since they‚Äôre
    owned by Amazon, but this was the last straw for me. I was done with
    Goodreads. Next step - find a new place to log my book reading
    habit, preferably with functional APIs where I could grab that
    data.</p>
    <p>My search for the perfect book catalogue with APIs didn‚Äôt get me
    very far. There aren‚Äôt very many sites that let you log your books
    and TBR (to be read, for you non-book nerds) list and retrieve them
    via an API. <a href="https://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>
    seemed like a good option, but their APIs weren‚Äôt going to do quite
    what I wanted. At this point, they‚Äôve disabled <a
    href="https://www.librarything.com/services/rest/documentation/1.1/">their
    APIs</a> as well (what is going on in the book API world??!?).</p>
    <p>I ultimately landed on <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open
    Library</a> as my book log provider of choice. While Open Library‚Äôs
    API doesn‚Äôt currently allow you to retrieve books that you‚Äôve
    logged, Open Library is open source! And not only is it ‚Äúopen
    source‚Äù but it actually has a great community of contributors and
    helpful, friendly staff. In my first couple days of exploring I was
    already able to PR a small feature request to the project ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
    <p>I was able to import all my Goodreads data into Open Library and
    I‚Äôm hopeful that me or another contributor can eventually add the
    functionality I need to their APIs so that my book backgrounds
    project can live on!</p>
    <h4 id="update">Update!!</h4>
    <p>Open Library totally <em>does</em> support doing what I want with
    <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">their REST API</a>.
    It‚Äôs not explicitly documented, but you can easily grab your reading
    lists as json, e.g.¬†<a
    href="https://openlibrary.org/people/stinkerelly/books/currently-reading"
    class="uri">https://openlibrary.org/people/stinkerelly/books/currently-reading</a>.</p>
    <p>More coming soon as I rework my ‚Äúspine generator‚Äù (AGAIN) using
    the Open Library REST API ü•≥</p>
