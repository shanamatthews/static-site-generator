    <h1 class="title">Workout Tracker</h1>
      <p class="date">2022-07-05</p>
    <p>I really enjoy working out, especially lifting weights and
    following a set program. One program I’d been trying for a while is
    called <a
    href="https://www.bretcontreras.store/products/strong-curves">Strong
    Curves</a> (cheesy, I know… they all have crap names). The program
    is highly structured, with each day following the same format,
    alternating between different exercises that all fit into certain
    categories.</p>
    <p>I’d been wanting to write my own workout tracker for a while and
    the format of this program lends itself well to writing a templated
    workout tracker.</p>
    <p>During my experiments with creating a “Zoom bookshelf” with D3, I
    found that I really enjoyed writing Javascript in <a
    href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>. Observable makes
    Javascript feel a lot more sane to my strictly-typed brain and
    basically creates UX for you, as long as you were okay with the
    default components provided.</p>
    <p>I’m always okay with default UX if it means I don’t have to write
    it, so I went ahead and created my own <a
    href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@shanamatthews/strong-curves-tracker">project
    on Observable</a>.</p>
    <p>Right now this project is set up to store workout data in JSON
    and save as a GitHub Gist on my own account. I’ve actually embedded
    a GitHub key (with only Gist permissions!!) in the project, which is
    a VERY BAD IDEA™️ , please don’t do this at home.</p>
    <p>It’s been super convenient for my development, but it means if
    you want to use this project for yourself, you’ll need to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Have a GitHub account</li>
    <li>Create a Gist named “A” (please don’t judge the process) with 3
    files in it named “A”, “B”, and “C” (to correspond to workout days
    A, B, C)</li>
    <li><a
    href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">Create
    a GitHub personal access token</a> with Gist write access</li>
    <li>Replace my Gist url (<code>gistUrl</code>) and GitHub token
    (<code>ghToken</code>) with your own. These variables can be found
    in the <a
    href="https://observablehq.com/@shanamatthews/strong-curves-tracker-scripts?collection=@shanamatthews/strong-curves-tracker">Tracker
    Scripts notebook</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’ve since ported (most) of this workout tracker to Svelte in my
    quest to be able to suck less at frontend development 😇 But that’s
    a story for a different post.</p>
    <p>Happy coding and go hit the gym!</p>
