    <p>I’m back from India! The trip went surprisingly well health-wise. I did have to take 7 (yes, SEVEN) different medications for my allergies/mast cell disorder, but I didn’t have any major issues and didn’t get sick, so, huge win.</p>

    <p>I… am joining the docs team at Sentry! I’ve been on the DevRel team under marketing, which increasingly doesn’t feel like the right fit given my hesitations about traveling and being a public figure. My new role will be a documentation engineer, focused on making <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s docs</a> great, both in terms of platform and content. My first day on the team will be 4/3. More to come soon!</p>
    <h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>[in-progress] “What is OpenTelemetry” article with another DevRel person from GCP.</li>
    <li>[paused] Dreaming of finishing my <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2023/02/07/profiling-101-what-is-profiling/">Profiling 101 series</a> (someday 💭)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="clippygpt">ClippyGPT</h4>
    <p>Definitely want to come back to <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs">this</a> but currently paused as I transition back from vacation.</p>
    <h4 id="microsoft-loop">Microsoft Loop</h4>
    <p>I finally got access to <a href="https://loop.microsoft.com/">Loop</a> as well as <a href="https://www.bing.com/new">“New Bing”</a>, but I’m weirdly over AI stuff right now. Its been dominating all the media so I’m not even playing with it. Instead, I’m checking out Microsoft’s new <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> clone. I love Notion, so very curious how Loop stacks up.</p>
    <p>It seems pretty on-par, other than Notion databases, which are arguably the best part of Notion. However, Loop’s tables may be doing more than I’m giving them credit for. Need to explore further.</p>

    <h3 id="articles-i-liked-this-week">Articles I liked this week</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://textiles-lab.github.io/publications/2018-autoknit/">Automatic Machine Knitting of 3D Meshes</a>. Highly relevant to my interests. Is there code I can run? I haven’t dug in enough to find it yet.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/osher/publications/weekly-essentials/covid-19/online-events-and-lectures/stress-relief.html">Bruce Rabin’s Managing Stress For Enhanced Health</a>. I did in fact take the time to watch all 8 parts of this series. I’m always interested in basic, science-based ways of improving your life and this extremely no-hype video series fit perfectly. Advice was basic, but easy to implement, like deep breathing, short meditations, and journaling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
    <p>I’m generally not much for podcasts, but I’ve been listening to <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/">Huberman Lab</a> a bit. Huberman himself is reminiscent of a “life hacker” bro, which I have very little tolerance for, but I was sucked in by the science of getting morning sunlight to keep your circadian rhythms in check. Jet lag from India is no joke!</p>

    <li>[finished] <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27309148W/Modern_Technical_Writing">Modern Technical Writing</a>. Very short and practical. An easy read to start to feel prepared for a role on a docs team. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
