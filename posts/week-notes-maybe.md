I was going through some old posts on a previous version of this blog recently and I found some of my old "week notes" posts, where I'd simply write up what I'd been doing that week. They usually contained updates on my kombucha brewing, knitting, reading, and some links to articles I read and liked during the week.

I'm sorta tempted to try doing these again, but I want to find a way to separate them from my more work-related posts... I'm going to think about how I could set implement that on this site with my lil baby static-site generator setup.

toodles!
