    <h1 class="title">I joined Sentry!</h1>
      <p class="date">2022-10-07</p>
    <p>Hello crew! I have an exciting life update - I’ve joined <a
    href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry</a> as a developer
    advocate.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-sentry">What is Sentry</h2>
    <p>Sentry is an open source application and performance monitoring
    tool that can be used with just about any language or framework.
    It’s totally free to use and open source (here’s <a
    href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">the code</a> and we also
    maintain a <a
    href="https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted">configuration
    repo</a> that you can use to run your own self-hosted version of
    Sentry with Docker.</p>
    <p>Sentry was originally created for Django to report errors, but
    has been expanded to work with most major development stacks. Right
    now, Sentry is mostly used by mobile and web developers, but <a
    href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/">supports just about
    everything</a>, including native C/C++ and gaming tools like
    Unreal.</p>
    <p>Sentry currently has about 250 employees, but it’s steadily
    growing.</p>
    <h2 id="why-sentry">Why Sentry</h2>
    <p>While working at both Microsoft and Coinbase I had some eerily
    similar experiences. Folks I met at events would be chatting with me
    and say something along the lines of “You’re too nice to work at
    <company-name>”. Even though I <em>think</em> they meant it as a
    compliment (???), it would make me think. Obviously, “niceness”
    wasn’t the problem; I knew lots of wonderfully kind people at both
    companies. The problem was working at companies that hadn’t built a
    good reputation in the developer community. Microsoft has come a
    long way since I first started there, I stopped getting those
    comments around 2019 or so, right around the time when their new
    developer advocacy program was gaining traction (coincidence? I
    think not).</p>
    <p>However, I’m really excited about the prospect of joining a
    company that <em>already</em> has a good reputation in the developer
    community and see how much further a great team of developer
    advocates can take it. As of now, the developer advocacy team is
    only 3 people and we all just started within the last few months, so
    there’s lots of room for growth!</p>
    <p>Another reason I’m excited about joining Sentry is the broad
    focus. Since Sentry is very easy for developers to use and integrate
    with (as opposed to the cloud!) and since Sentry supports so many
    tools, there’s always an opportunity to learn and introduce Sentry
    to a new audience.</p>
    <h2 id="what-will-i-be-doing">What will I be doing?</h2>
    <p>Since joining Sentry, the main thing I’ve been doing is helping
    prep for our developer conference, <a
    href="https://sentry.io/events/dex/">DEX</a>, which happened on
    September 28th. I helped out by prepping internal speakers and
    creating a Discord bot that polled attendees about their favorite
    developer tools and showed a live updating data visualization of
    votes as they came in. It was a fun challenge to get something
    working on a super short time frame using tools I’m definitely not
    an expert at (looking at you D3). I’m working on a blog post about
    creating that bot which should be published in the next week or
    so.</p>
    <p>What’s next after DEX? Great question! The team has just come
    together, so we’re still setting our priorities, but we’ll
    definitely be around. I’m hoping to get my feet wet in the Django
    community and brush of my Python!</p>
    <p>I’m also planning to start streaming some of my work, on <a
    href="https://www.twitch.tv/shanacodes">Twitch</a> (catch my first
    stream next week!). During October, the whole devrel team will be
    streaming for Hacktober on Wednesdays at 10am Pacific. It’ll be
    broadcast to our Sentry Youtube channel at <a
    href="https://bit.ly/Hacktoberfest-2022">https://bit.ly/Hacktoberfest-2022</a>
    and each of our personal Twitch channels.</p>
