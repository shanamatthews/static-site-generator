## Working



## Experimenting

### This website

My posts folder is getting really messy, so I was trying to edit the bash script so it could accept nested post folders. I spent longer than 30 min on it without success, which I think means its time to move on to rewriting this thing in a more sane language, like Go.

### ClippyGPT



### Microsoft Loop


## Producing

- [in-progress] "What is OpenTelemetry" article with another DevRel person from GCP.
- [paused] Dreaming of finishing my Profiling 101 series (someday üí≠)

## Consuming

### Articles I liked this week

- [Automatic Machine Knitting of 3D Meshes](https://textiles-lab.github.io/publications/2018-autoknit/). Highly relevant to my interests. Is there code I can run? I haven't dug in enough to find it yet.
- [Bruce Rabin's Managing Stress For Enhanced Health](https://www.cmu.edu/osher/publications/weekly-essentials/covid-19/online-events-and-lectures/stress-relief.html). I did in fact take the time to watch all 8 parts of this series. I'm always interested in basic, science-based ways of improving your life and this extremely no-hype video series fit perfectly. Advice was basic, but easy to implement, like deep breathing, short meditations, and journaling.

### Podcasts

I'm generally not much for podcasts, but I've been listening to [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) a bit. Huberman himself is reminiscent of a "life hacker" bro, which I have very little tolerance for, but I was sucked in by the science of getting morning sunlight to keep your circadian rhythms in check. Jet lag from India is no joke!

### Books

- [in-progress] [Never Bet Against Occam](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20811242W/Never_Bet_Against_Occam). Reading this to learn more about mastocytosis :(
- [in-progress] [My Grandmother's Hands](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19718843W/My_grandmother%27s_hands?edition=ia%3Amygrandmothersha0000mena)
- [paused] [Moby Dick](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL21501229W/Moby_Dick?edition=ia%3Amobydick0000melv_c9t5). Reading as [Whale Weekly](https://whaleweekly.substack.com/about) Sad to pause it, but I'm way behind on my Substacks.
- [paused] [Spare](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL29240850W/Spare)
- [paused] [Unsettled Ground](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL25758323W/Unsettled_Ground)
- [finished] [Modern Technical Writing](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27309148W/Modern_Technical_Writing). Very short and practical. An easy read to start to feel prepared for a role on a docs team. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
