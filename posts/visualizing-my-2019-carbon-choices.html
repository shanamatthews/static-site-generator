    <h1 class="title">visualizing my 2019 carbon choices</h1>
      <p>2019 marked a change in the global discussion of climate change
      and carbon emissions. I’ve been conscious of my impact for a while
      and generally tried to make good choices. However, while
      reflecting on my 2019, I realized I needed to do more.</p>
      <p>I think of myself as a logical problem solver, but I’ve been
      approaching the problem of my environmental impact from an
      emotional standpoint. I feel <em>guilty</em> for having a negative
      impact on the environment and to alleviate this guilt, I do things
      that <em>feel</em> like they help, like eating less meat, buying
      from “eco-friendly” retailers, and avoiding single-use
      plastics.</p>
      <p>Not to say that these aren’t fantastic things to do (I continue
      to do them), but I had a sneaking suspicion that those weren’t the
      actions that had the most impact. I chose them because of how they
      made <em>me</em> feel, not the benefit they had on the planet.</p>
      <p>For 2020, I decided to take a more data-driven approach to the
      problem of my carbon footprint. That starts with understanding
      what impact my current actions have, so I can make improvements
      that have the most benefit. As a start, I did research to
      determine the relative impact of some of the choices I made in
      2019.</p>
      <p>Before I get into it, I want to give a couple of
      disclaimers:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>There’s some controversy about whether or not individual
      actions matter at all<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and whether
      discussing the impact individual actions may actually be harmful.
      Some research indicates that emphasizing individual solutions to
      big issues can reduce support for government efforts<a href="#fn2"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. That being said, I am still
      of the opinion that individual efforts can be worthwhile if done
      correctly, so I want to share mine.</li>
      <li>I decided to start with data about my carbon footprint because
      that’s the easiest thing to quantify. I’m open to feedback about
      other types of impact I should be measuring.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To get started, I researched the carbon footprint of a
      selection of things I did during 2019, both positive and negative.
      This helped me get a feel for what actually made a difference.
      Once I started researching, the answer became clear very
      quickly.</p>
      <h2 id="the-carbon-footprint-of-some-things-i-did-in-2019">the
      carbon footprint of some things I did in 2019</h2>

      emissions in metric tons per year.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><em>Bar chart displaying my 2020 carbon emissions in metric
      tons per year.</em></p>
      <p>Some actions matter a lot more than others, and at least for
      me, it’s not the ones that <em>feel</em> particularly good (or
      bad).</p>
      <p>I flew from Seattle to Sydney for work, business class (yes,
      cabin kind of makes a difference<a href="#fn3"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>), in the fall of 2019 to
      deliver a workshop about Python and data science. Everything else
      I did last year, good or bad, was almost negligible compared to
      that one round-trip flight.</p>
      <p>In 2019 I also made the change from being totally vegetarian to
      eating some meat (pretty much only chicken) and felt really guilty
      about it. It turns out I shouldn’t have. Every flight I took, even
      the small hop from Seattle to Denver (in economy), was <em>more
      than double</em> the impact of me eating chicken all year
      long.</p>
      <p>In contrast, I also felt really good about cutting down
      dramatically on my car use by taking transit into work every day.
      It turns out… I shouldn’t have. While exclusively taking transit
      to work more than made up for me eating chicken, it didn’t matter
      compared to my 3 different flights from Seattle to Pittsburgh
      (again, business) for work.</p>
      <p>I’d seen this infographic around the internet: <img
      src="../images/impact.jpg"
      alt="Infographic of personal choices to reduce your contribution to climate change" /></p>
      <p><em><a
      href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta">Source:
      Environmental Research Letters</a></em></p>
      <p>And I “knew” that flying was bad. But it took me creating the
      above graph about my own life and choices to really get it.</p>
      <p>People can’t be perfect. Sometimes we have to fly! To really
      make a difference, the system needs to change. But as an
      individual motivated to do my part, the actions I should take to
      help are very obvious.</p>
      <p>I’ve committed to flying less in 2020, especially for work, and
      encouraging my teammates to do the same.</p>

      <h3 id="how-i-calculated-my-carbon-footprint">how I calculated my
      carbon footprint</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Flights</strong>: <a
      href="https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3"
      class="uri">https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3</a></p>
      <p>Work flights were business, personal as premium economy or
      economy. I didn’t calculate my connections, just origin direct to
      destination, so most of my numbers are actually
      underestimates.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Starting to eat chicken</strong>: <a
      href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/2/5865109/study-going-vegetarian-could-cut-your-food-carbon-footprint-in-half"
      class="uri">https://www.vox.com/2014/7/2/5865109/study-going-vegetarian-could-cut-your-food-carbon-footprint-in-half</a></p>
      <p>I got this number by calculating myself as a “low-meat” diet
      person vs. a “vegetarian” with the per-day numbers given,
      multiplying out to a year and converting to metric tons.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Commuting</strong>: <a
      href="https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=4"
      class="uri">https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=4</a></p>
      <p>My commute is 23 miles round trip (annoyingly long, I know. My
      fault for wanting to live in the “cool” neighborhood). I got this
      number by calculating the difference between driving that and
      using a “coach” - provided by my employer (and always full). I’m
      also lucky enough to work from home 1x/week and calculated that
      footprint simply by determining what 1/5th my commuting footprint
      is.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Books</strong>: <a
      href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00414.x"
      class="uri">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00414.x</a></p>
      <p>I also embraced my love for physical books last year, rather
      than using my e-reader. I still primarily use my local library and
      buy used, but I do buy new books from time to time. I found this
      very interesting calculation and decided to include it. I arrived
      at my yearly number by multiplying the footprint of one book by 12
      (an overestimate, I buy fewer new books than this) and converting
      to metric tons.</p></li>

      <p>the tl;dr is that the majority of carbon offset projects don’t
      pan out <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. They mostly serve as a
      feel-good “pass” for individuals and companies to use carbon,
      guilt-free. Maybe I’ll write about it!</p>
