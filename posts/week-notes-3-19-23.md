I'm back from India! The trip went surprisingly well health-wise. I did have to take 7 (yes, SEVEN) different medications for my allergies/mast cell disorder, but I didn't have any major issues and didn't get sick, so, huge win.

## Working

I... am joining the docs team at Sentry! I've been on the DevRel team under marketing, which increasingly doesn't feel like the right fit given my hesitations about traveling and being a public figure. I'll be a documentation engineer, focused on making [Sentry's docs](https://docs.sentry.io/) great, both in terms of platform and content. My first day on the team will be 4/3. More to come soon!

## Experimenting

### ClippyGPT

Definitely want to come back to [this](https://supabase.com/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs) but currently paused as I transition back from vacation.

### Microsoft Loop

I finally got access to [Loop](https://loop.microsoft.com/) as well as ["New Bing"](https://www.bing.com/new), but I'm weirdly over AI stuff right now. Its been dominating all the media so I'm not even playing with it. Instead, I'm checking out Microsoft's new [Notion](https://notion.so/) clone. I love Notion, so very curious how Loop stacks up.

It seems pretty on-par, other than Notion databases, which are arguably the best part of Notion. However, Loop's tables may be doing more than I'm giving them credit for. Need to explore further.

## Producing

- [in-progress] "What is OpenTelemetry" article with another DevRel person from GCP.
- [paused] Dreaming of finishing my Profiling 101 series (someday üí≠)

## Consuming

### Articles I liked this week

- [Automatic Machine Knitting of 3D Meshes](https://textiles-lab.github.io/publications/2018-autoknit/). Highly relevant to my interests. Is there code I can run? I haven't dug in enough to find it yet.
- [Bruce Rabin's Managing Stress For Enhanced Health](https://www.cmu.edu/osher/publications/weekly-essentials/covid-19/online-events-and-lectures/stress-relief.html). I did in fact take the time to watch all 8 parts of this series. I'm always interested in basic, science-based ways of improving your life and this extremely no-hype video series fit perfectly. Advice was basic, but easy to implement, like deep breathing, short meditations, and journaling.

### Podcasts

I'm generally not much for podcasts, but I've been listening to [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) a bit. Huberman himself is reminiscent of a "life hacker" bro, which I have very little tolerance for, but I was sucked in by the science of getting morning sunlight to keep your circadian rhythms in check. Jet lag from India is no joke!

### Books

- [in-progress] [Never Bet Against Occam](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20811242W/Never_Bet_Against_Occam). Reading this to learn more about mastocytosis :(
- [in-progress] [My Grandmother's Hands](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19718843W/My_grandmother%27s_hands?edition=ia%3Amygrandmothersha0000mena)
- [paused] [Moby Dick](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL21501229W/Moby_Dick?edition=ia%3Amobydick0000melv_c9t5). Reading as [Whale Weekly](https://whaleweekly.substack.com/about) Sad to pause it, but I'm way behind on my Substacks.
- [paused] [Spare](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL29240850W/Spare)
- [paused] [Unsettled Ground](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL25758323W/Unsettled_Ground)
- [finished] [Modern Technical Writing](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27309148W/Modern_Technical_Writing). Very short and practical. An easy read to start to feel prepared for a role on a docs team. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
