    <h1 class="title">Spine Generator Open Library Edition</h1>
      <p class="date">2022-05-24</p>
    <p>Even though my Spine Generator project is done to death, I was
    inspired to redo the data/backend ONE MORE TIME when I realized I
    actually was able to grab my book data from Open Library via API.
    While I was working on it, I also decided to give it a little
    facelift by grabbing cover colors from the <a
    href="https://github.com/colorjs/get-image-colors">get-image-colors
    library</a> rather than <a
    href="https://jariz.github.io/vibrant.js/">Vibrant.js</a> which was
    just not designed to do what I wanted it to.</p>
    <p>And since I got that looking significantly prettier, I also added
    some futzing around with random fonts and properly centering the
    text on the books (as opposed to the strange hack I had before üòÖ)
    so that titles don‚Äôt run off the edge of the books‚Ä¶ usually.</p>

    <h2 id="a-lil-more-detail-if-ur-curious">A lil more detail if ur
    curious</h2>
    <p>Writing about <a href="/posts/goodreads-to-open-library.html">how
    excited I am about Open Library</a> got me poking around the <a
    href="https://openlibrary.org/developers">Open Library APIs</a> a
    bit more until I realized it‚Äôs <strong>totally</strong> possible for
    me to grab my lists of currently reading, read, and want to read
    books, as long as I keep those lists public on my profile.</p>
    <p>It‚Äôs not documented super well, but reading the ‚Äúfine print‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3 id="more-apis">More APIs</h3>
    <p>Did you know, nearly every page on Open Library is or has an API.
    You can return structured bibliographic data for any page by adding
    a .rdf/.json/.yml extension to the end of any Open Library
    identifier. For instance:
    https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15626917W.json or
    https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL33421A.json. Many pages, such as
    the Books, Authors, and Lists, will include links to their RDF and
    JSON formats.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I started to wonder if the lists under <strong>my</strong>
    profile page might be included in the ‚Äúnearly every page‚Äù that has
    an API‚Ä¶ It was easy enough to check, I was able to do a quick
    <code>curl</code> to the url and bam:</p>

    <p>We‚Äôve got data!</p>
    <p>After this was working, I really thought that it was going to be
    super easy to integrate this with my existing visualization. And, it
    was! Except I got a little to excited that this was finally üéâ
    <strong>working</strong>‚ú® the way I had wanted from the very
    beginning and decided to start changing everything. Classic.</p>
