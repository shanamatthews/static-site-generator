      <p class="date">2023-02-23</p>
    <p>The performance of your app matters. From ensuring a good user
    experience to retaining users, <a
    href="https://web.dev/why-speed-matters/">performance makes a
    difference</a> in your app’s success. Using the right tools can make
    it easier to ensure your code is meeting your performance goals,
    before you have to switch to a bigger EC2 instance or users start
    complaining.</p>
    <p>One of the best tools in a developer’s toolbox for ensuring good
    performance is profiling. It’s extremely difficult to predict
    precisely where your code will be slow in production, which is one
    of the many reasons people recommend against premature optimization.
    However, profiling tools can show you the exact lines in your code
    that are slow and enable you to make and test specific
    optimizations.</p>
    <p>This 3 part series will explain what profiling is, why you should
    be profiling your code in production, and explore some popular tools
    for profiling.</p>

    profiling?</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-profiling">What is profiling?</h2>
    <p>While profiling may be a new term for many developers, profiling
    tools have been around for decades. Profiling is a way to capture a
    snapshot of a program’s resource usage, called a profile, and
    connect that snapshot to the codebase in a way that allows you to
    directly map resource usage to lines of code. Profiling is a type of
    dynamic analysis, meaning it measures the code as it runs. This
    means profiling allows you to get an accurate picture of how your
    code is behaving both locally and in production, including
    interactions with databases and other services.</p>
    <h2 id="how-is-profiling-different-than-distributed-tracing">How is
    profiling different than distributed tracing?</h2>
    <p>Before we dig into the details of profiling, let’s take a moment
    to discuss the difference between profiling and tracing.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/">Tracing</a>
    is another tool commonly used for monitoring performance. Tracing
    tracks the flow and timing of requests as they pass through a
    system, which helps you understand the performance of that system
    and identify bottlenecks. A trace is a log of events that occurred
    during a program’s execution. Distributed tracing creates these
    traces through a distributed system, e.g. tracking across your
    backend and your frontend.</p>
    <p>By tracing a request from the frontend to the backend, and back
    again, you can get insight into which services are involved and how
    long they take. Often, external services and databases are the
    biggest cause of latency in your app, and tracing is great at
    identifying and measuring these slowdowns.</p>
    <p>However, if your app is slow due to internal issues rather than
    external calls, tracing may not be as good at showing you exactly
    where the problem is. The information you can get from a trace is
    only as granular as the spans you’ve manually instrumented in your
    code. A CPU profiler, on the other hand, can give you function and
    line level detail about where your code is slow, without needing to
    instrument every function.</p>
    <h2 id="types-of-profilers">Types of profilers</h2>
    <p>Profiling is a very broad term and profilers can be implemented
    in a variety of ways. For example, the data a profiler collects can
    include usage of CPU, GPU, memory, I/O, networking and more. Most
    profilers only include one or two types of this data. Most modern
    profiling tools are CPU profilers that measure the performance of
    code running on a CPU, and the rest of this series will focus on CPU
    profilers.</p>
    <p>In addition, most of the examples we’ll use in this post are
    about frontend and backend development, but profiling is useful to
    understand the performance of any type of code. In fact, profilers
    have been in use since the 1970’s to improve the performance of
    operating systems and compilers.</p>
    <h3
    id="continuous-profiling-ad-hoc-profiling-and-transaction-based-profiling">Continuous
    profiling, ad hoc profiling, and transaction-based profiling</h3>
    <p>Profiling can either be done continuously (i.e. all the time), ad
    hoc (e.g. collecting a profile of your site manually using a tool
    like Chrome DevTools), or somewhere in the middle.</p>
    <p><strong>Ad hoc profiling</strong></p>
    <p>Ad hoc profiling is the easiest way to get a profile for your web
    app, but most ad hoc profiling tools have limited capabilities. One
    very popular ad hoc profiling tool is the Chrome DevTools
    performance panel. It allows you to record a basic CPU profile for
    any website by pressing a button. While this and other ad hoc
    profiling tools are convenient for getting a quick look at a
    website’s performance, the data collected in the profile isn’t very
    complete.</p>
    <p>Chrome DevTools profiles are primarily useful for getting a quick
    understanding of the performance of a website’s frontend — but can’t
    accurately capture data for the backend. In addition, the profile is
    specific to your machine and may not accurately reflect the
    experience other users are having. Finally, there’s no easy way to
    automate collecting these profiles in DevTools, so you would need to
    manually create a profile every time you want to look at performance
    data and hope that profile accurately represents user
    experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Continuous profiling</strong></p>
    <p>At the other extreme, continuous profiling is the gold standard
    for comprehensive profile data. A continuous profile is a long
    running profile that is automatically collected over the entire
    runtime of an application or an entire user session. In contrast to
    ad hoc profiling, continuous profiling runs automatically during
    every user session. This enables you to get a clear picture of
    actual user experience at any time of day, using computed metrics
    like wall time (the amount of real-world time a call takes to
    complete).</p>
    <p>Of course, continuous profiling also comes with downsides.
    Continuous profiles can be arbitrarily long, which can make them
    hard to work with and find information in, and require processing
    large amounts of data.</p>
    <p><strong>Transaction-based profiling</strong></p>
    <p>In between ad hoc profiling and continuous profiling, there is a
    wide spectrum of possible other profiling configurations— including
    transaction-based profiling. Transaction-based profiling is a
    profiling method that automatically collects a profile while a
    transaction is happening in your app.</p>
    <p>Transactions are a concept from tracing. A transaction is a
    single instance of a service being called in your app inside of an
    important operation — like a page load, navigation, or async task. A
    collection of transactions make up a trace.</p>
    <figure>

    alt="Spans, transactions, traces diagram" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Spans, transactions, traces
    diagram</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Transaction-based profiling offers the benefits of automatic
    profiling, capturing what’s actually happening on your users’
    machines as it happens, but doesn’t collect as much data as
    continuous profiling. In transaction-based profiling, profiles are
    automatically collected only while a transaction is happening.</p>
    <p>This makes it possible to either collect profiles 1:1 with
    transactions (e.g. each transaction captured also captures a
    profile) or to undersample profile collection relative to
    transactions, which means that while each profile is associated with
    a transaction, not every transaction has a profile. Since collecting
    a profile is more computationally-intensive than capturing a
    transaction, undersampling can help ensure your profiling tool
    itself isn’t making your app’s performance worse.</p>
    <p>Additionally, linking profiles to transactions provides a
    straightforward mental model for exploring and understanding
    performance data from transactions and profiles.</p>
    <p>Here’s a summary table showing the differences between ad hoc
    profiling, continuous profiling, and transaction-based
    profiling.</p>

    <h3 id="deterministic-vs.-sampling-profilers">Deterministic
    vs. sampling profilers</h3>
    <p>There are many ways to implement a profiling tool. CPU Profilers
    typically fall into two categories— deterministic and sampling —
    depending on how the profiles are collected.</p>
    <p><strong>Deterministic profilers</strong></p>
    <p>Deterministic profiles are also known as tracing profilers.
    They prioritize accuracy over performance. They capture all function
    call, function return, and exception events, and also record precise
    timings for the intervals between these events.</p>
    <p><strong>Sampling profilers</strong></p>
    <p>Sampling profilers, or statistical profilers, prioritize not
    adding performance overhead. They grab the call stack at regular
    intervals, collecting samples from each thread and computing
    function durations using statistical techniques.</p>
    <p>For example, if a call stack capture shows function A calling
    function B calling function C (A → B → C) and the next capture 10ms
    later shows A → B without C, we can interpolate the function
    duration of C to be about 10ms since it existed on the stack at the
    first sample and no longer exists as of the second sample.</p>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Deterministic
    vs. sampling</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>All profilers can use a deterministic or sampling approach to
    collecting profiles regardless of how they are run, but the
    distinction matters a lot more for continuous and transaction-based
    profiling tools that run automatically in production, since any
    performance overhead they add directly impacts users.</p>
    <p>While deterministic profilers give a fuller picture of what’s
    going on, measuring every function call in production has a high
    overhead. In contrast, statistical profilers have a fixed overhead
    with regard to the number of function calls. Using a statistical
    profiler instead of a deterministic profiler ensures the profiler
    will have a lower and more consistent performance overhead in
    production. Because of this, most profilers used in production are
    sampling profilers.</p>
    <h2 id="does-profiling-my-app-impact-its-performance">Does profiling
    my app impact its performance?</h2>
    <p>Based on what you’ve read about deterministic vs. sampling
    profilers, you’re probably wondering how much overhead profiling
    actually adds to your code in production.</p>
    <p>In general, the more data the profiler collects and the more
    often it collects it, the greater performance impact the profiler
    will have. As mentioned, sampling profilers almost always have a
    lower overhead than deterministic profilers.</p>
    <p><a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/profiling/">Sentry makes
    transaction-based sampling profilers</a> for Android, iOS, Node and
    Python. While overhead varies by platform, hardware, and the
    application being profiled, all of Sentry’s profiling products
    target a &lt;10% CPU time overhead.</p>
    <p>And of course, for ad hoc profilers, collecting a profile of your
    code only affects performance while that ad hoc profile is being
    collected.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Getting started with profiling can be intimidating, especially
    because the term “profiler” is used to refer to so many specific
    types of tools.</p>
