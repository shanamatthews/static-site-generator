How did I miss [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/)? Probably because I'm a known Node hater and I actively ignore all the hype about new full stack JS frameworks.

Something about educational content in the browser

I think ease of learning will dominate over time, and I'm increasingly confident Node will dominate the backend
I definitely need to put my beef with Node in the past.
