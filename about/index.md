I'm a software engineer and writer, currently at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome) who cares about making tools simple and documentation awesome.

<!-- I like to think of myself as half developer, half librarian -->

Fun facts about me:

- Every version of Windows since 2016 has shipped with code Iâ€™ve written.
- I once delayed a Windows 10 major release (2x/year) because I didn't thoroughly test a code review suggestion ðŸ¤—
- I've only ever worked on products and tools for developers. I just don't find myself interested in working on products for folks who aren't engineers.
