I'm a software engineer and developer advocate who cares about making tools simple and documentation awesome.

Fun facts about me:

- Every version of Windows since 2016 has shipped with code Iâ€™ve written
- I once delayed a Windows 10 major release (every 6 months) because I didn't thoroughly test a code review suggestion ðŸ¤—
- I've only ever worked on products and tools for developers. I don't think I could ever build for a non-developer audience.
