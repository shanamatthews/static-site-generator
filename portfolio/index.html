      <p>Regardless of job title (software engineer, developer advocate,
      technical writer, etc.), I’ve spent my career creating content and
      tools to help developers build things.</p>
      <p>While I have experience <a href="../talks/index.html">giving
      talks</a> and creating video content, my preference has always
      been for creating written content, especially tutorials and
      API/SDK documentation. Written content is more maintainable,
      flexible, and accessible than video content, and in my opinion,
      more useful.</p>
      <p>This page gives some examples of written content that I’ve
      worked on.</p>
      <h2 id="sdk-and-api-docs">SDK and API docs</h2>
      <!-- ### Sentry -->
      <p>I work at <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">sentry.io</a>
      where I maintain Sentry SDK docs in collaboration with the SDK
      developers. I also maintain the <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/">docs site
      itself</a> (a Gatsby project hosted on Vercel), and the API docs
      in collaboration with product engineers.</p>
      <p>Sentry is open source and part of my job is to empower external
      contributors. This involves triaging and routing issues, and
      helping contributors make pull requests to our docs repo. This
      also involves helping Sentry employees make <a
      href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">internal documentation
      public</a>, so external contributors can contribute to Sentry SDKs
      and product code. Since our docs site is open source, you can see
      all my contributions to Sentry’s docs via the <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/commits?author=shanamatthews">project’s
      commit history</a>.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/">Sentry SDK
      docs</a>. Sentry provides SDKs to for more than 20 languages. Each
      SDK is custom, with slightly different features and API surface.
      This gives the best user experience, but requires more work to
      maintain accurate documentation.
      <ul>
      <li>I collaborate with 12 full-time SDK developers plus additional
      contractors to keep our SDK docs up to date. This includes
      ensuring docs are consistent between SDKs and adhere to our docs
      best practices and internal style guide.</li>
      <li>I also work on bigger projects like <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/8152">improving
      our information architecture</a> and coordinating across the
      organization to make sure <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/6808">new
      SDKs</a> ship with docs included.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/">Sentry API docs</a>.
      Sentry provides a REST API to access the Sentry platform
      programmatically. Our API docs are created using OpenAPI 3 and
      custom code to generate pages in Gatsby from the OpenAPI spec.
      Older endpoints require you to manually edit the OpenAPI spec, but
      newer endpoints use <a
      href="https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code>drf-spectacular</code></a>
      to automatically create OpenAPI spec entries from the code.
      <ul>
      <li>I collaborate with product engineers ensure new endpoints are
      published with API docs that follow our best practices and style
      guide.</li>
      <li>This also involves publishing documentation for Sentry
      engineers and external contributors on <a
      href="https://develop.sentry.dev/api/public/">how to publish new
      endpoints</a>. I worked closely with the lead engineer for
      Sentry’s APIs to rewrite our internal docs on creating new APIs
      and make the <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/api/">new docs
      set public</a>.</li>
      <li>Here are some specific endpoints I helped document:
      <ul>
      <li><a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/alerts/create-a-metric-alert-rule-for-an-organization/">Create
      a Metric Alert Rule for an Organization</a>. Sentry’s Metric Alert
      Rules are complex. While creating docs for this endpoint I
      collaborated with the technical writer who owns the product docs
      for <a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts">Metric
      Alert Rules</a> to revamp those docs and cross link between them
      to ensure all necessary information was available from both
      pages.</li>
      <li><a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/alerts/create-an-issue-alert-rule-for-a-project/">Create
      an Issue Alert Rule for a Project</a>. This endpoint also required
      extensive documentation, including JSON snippets to better explain
      how to provide the correct data formats as params.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>

      API docs for Coinbase Chainnode</a>. I authored API docs for an
      alpha version of <a
      href="https://github.com/coinbase/chainnode">Coinbase
      Chainnode</a> for 10 large Coinbase customers. These docs use <a
      href="https://open-rpc.org/">OpenRPC</a>, a specification and set
      of tools to document JSON-RPC APIs, based on OpenAPI. OpenRPC
      tooling is less mature than OpenAPI and there’s no tool to
      generate OpenRPC specs from code. This meant I had to create the
      (2460 line) <a
      href="https://github.com/shanamatthews/node-openrpc/blob/main/node-openrpc.json">OpenRPC
      spec</a> by hand, including example requests and results, and
      reusable OpenRPC objects for all object types (see
      “<code>components</code>”). Authoring these docs required very
      close collaboration with the engineers building the beta APIs,
      including participating in API design reviews and reading the
      Golang codebase. I left Coinbase before this project’s beta
      release, and it appears the product’s final scope is significantly
      smaller than was planned.</li>

      <ul>
      <li><p><a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/">Frontend
      Error Monitoring Tutorial</a>. I rewrote this tutorial to bring it
      up to date and demonstrate Sentry best practices, as well as
      follow docs best practices and style guide. I also created a new
      <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/frontend-tutorial">React
      sample app</a> for this tutorial that uses Webpack without
      <code>create-react-app</code> to more accurately represent user
      experience.</p></li>
      <li><p><a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/guides/create-auth-token/">Create
      a Sentry Authentication Token</a> and <a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/guides/teams-tutorial/">Create
      and List Teams with the Sentry API</a>. Authored these two new
      beginner-friendly tutorials to help users authenticate and get
      started with Sentry’s APIs. The prerequisites for authenticating
      with Sentry’s APIs is nonstandard and I created these tutorials to
      mitigate user confusion as engineering work happened to make
      authentication easier.</p></li>
