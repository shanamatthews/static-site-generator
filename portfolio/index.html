      <p>Regardless of job title (software engineer, developer advocate,
      technical writer, etc.), I’ve spent my career creating content and
      tools to help developers make things.</p>
      <p>While I have experience <a href="../talks/index.html">giving
      talks</a> and creating video content, my preference has always
      been for creating written content, especially tutorials and
      API/SDK documentation. Written content is more maintainable,
      flexible, and accessible than video, and frankly, more useful, in
      my opinion.</p>
      <p>This page gives some examples of written content that I’ve
      worked on.</p>
      <h2 id="api-and-sdk-docs">API and SDK docs</h2>
      <!-- ### Sentry -->
      <p>I currently work at <a
      href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">sentry.io</a> where I maintain
      Sentry SDK docs in collaboration with the SDK developers. I also
      maintain the <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/">docs site
      itself</a> (a Gatsby project hosted on Vercel), and the API docs
      in collaboration with product engineers.</p>
      <p>Sentry is open source and part of my role also includes
      empowering external contributors, both by working with them on
      docs contributions, and by helping Sentry employees make <a
      href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">internal documentation
      public</a> so external contributors can contribute to Sentry SDKs
      and product code. Additionally, since our docs site is open
      source, you can see all my contributions to Sentry’s docs via the
      <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/commits?author=shanamatthews">project’s
      commit history</a>.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p><a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/">Sentry SDK
      docs</a>. Sentry provides SDKs to add to your project to collect
      error and performance data for more than 20 languages. Each SDK is
      custom written to work best with its language and each SDK has
      slightly different features and API surface. This gives the best
      user experience, but requires more work to maintain accurate
      documentation. I collaborate with 12 full-time SDK developers plus
      additional contractors to keep our SDK docs up to date. I help
      make sure docs are consistent between SDKs and adhere to our docs
      best practices and internal style guide. I also collaborate on
      bigger projects like <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/8152">improving
      our information architecture</a> and coordinating across the
      organization to ensure <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/6808">new
      SDKs</a> ship with docs included.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/">Sentry API docs</a>.
      Sentry provides a REST API to access the Sentry platform
      programmatically. Our API docs are created using OpenAPI 3 and
      custom code to generate pages in Gatsby from the OpenAPI spec.
      Older endpoints require you to manually edit the OpenAPI spec, but
      newer endpoints use <a
      href="https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code>drf-spectacular</code></a>
      to automatically create OpenAPI spec entries from the code. I
      collaborate with product engineers working to publish new
      endpoints to ensure they also publish API docs that follow our
      best practices and style guide. This involved authoring
      documentation for Sentry engineers about <a
      href="https://develop.sentry.dev/api/public/">how to publish new
      endpoints</a>. Since Sentry is fully open-source, Sentry
      encourages employees to make internal docs public whenever
      possible. I also worked closely with the lead engineer for
      Sentry’s APIs to rewrite our internal docs on creating creating
      new APIs and make the <a
      href="https://develop.sentry.dev/api/">new docs public</a>. This
      enables external contributors to help author APIs.</p></li>

      <ul>
      <li><p><a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/">Frontend
      Error Monitoring Tutorial</a>. I created a new <a
      href="https://github.com/getsentry/frontend-tutorial">React sample
      app</a> for this tutorial, that uses Webpack without
      <code>create-react-app</code> to more accurately represent user
      experience. I also rewrote the tutorial content to demonstrate
      Sentry best practices and highlight new features, as well as
      follow docs best practices and style guide.</p></li>
      <li><p><a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/guides/create-auth-token/">Create
      a Sentry Authentication Token</a> and <a
      href="https://docs.sentry.io/api/guides/teams-tutorial/">Create
      and List Teams with the Sentry API</a>. Authored two new
      beginner-friendly tutorials to help users authenticate and get
      started with Sentry’s APIs. The prerequisites for authenticating
      with Sentry’s APIs is nonstandard and I created these tutorials to
      mitigate user confusion as engineering work happened to make
      authentication easier. <!--
